# x264 Optimal Settings
First of all, for output we're gonna use the `Advanced` Output Mode.</br>

# Streaming
[TL;DR Jump](#tldr-streaming)</br>
In the streaming tab, select the `x264` encoder.
Change the `Rate Control` to `CBR`, set `Keyframe Interval` to `2s` and change `Profile` to `High`.</br>

## Bitrate
Bitrate is dependent on your streaming service and on your internet, here's a link to the [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en) and the [Twitch](https://stream.twitch.tv/encoding/) bitrate guides.
  
## CPU Usage Preset
This one varies from system to system, the preset goes from `ultrafast` (the lowest CPU usage, worst quality) to `placebo` (highest CPU usage, best quality).

## x264 Options
**(B-Frames)**</br>
I recommend setting it to 2-4 depending on what type of game you are playing. If you are playing fast-paced games with a lot of motion, use `2`.
(`bframes=2` to `bframes=4`)
  
Final options: `bframes=? keyint=2 min-keyint=2 aq-mode=3 rc_lookahead=60` (options are separated by spaces).

# Recording
[TL;DR Jump](#tldr-recording)</br>
In the recording tab, select the `x264` encoder.
Change the `Rate Control` to `CRF`, set keyframe interval to `1s` and change `Profile` to `High`.

## CRF Level
CQ Level determines the overall quality and file-size of the video, it can range from 1 (the best quality, and the highest file-size) to 51 (the worst quality, and the smallest file-size).</br></br>
I would recommend the following values:</br></br>
**Lossless** => 0;</br>
**Near Lossless** => 1-5;</br>
**Indistinguishable** => 6-10;</br>
**High Quality** => 11-16;</br>
**Tolerable Quality** => 17-21;</br>

## CPU Usage Preset
This one varies from system to system, the preset goes from `ultrafast` (the lowest CPU usage, worst quality) to `placebo` (highest CPU usage, best quality).

## x264 Options
`bframes=0 keyint=1 min-keyint=1` (options are separated by spaces).
