# Video Settings
Let's start out, shall we?</br></br>
If you want to record at the **native resolution** of your monitor, set the resolution of both boxes to your monitor's.</br>
`Base (Canvas) Resolution` represents the "scene" resolution.</br>
`Output (Scaled) Resolution` represents the final video resolution (must be lower or equal to the `Base Resolution`).

## Downscale Filter
**Note**: the downscale filter should **only** be used if your output resolution is lower than your base resolution.

**Billinear** => Fastest, but blurry if scaling</br>
**Area** => Fast, but has decent scaling</br>
**Bicubic** => Slow, but has good scaling</br>
**Lanczos** => Slowest, but has the best scaling</br>

Choose depending on your hardware.</br>

## FPS
Use `Common FPS Values`, and choose `60 FPS` (if your computer **cannot** handle `60 FPS`, please go ahead and use `30 FPS`).
