# Video Settings
Let's start out, shall we?</br>
If you want to record at the **native resolution** of your monitor, select the *first* item in the combo box.</br>
`Base (Canvas) Resolution` represents the "scene" resolution.</br>
`Output (Scaled) Resolution` represents the final video resolution (must be lower or equal to the `Base Resolution`).

## Downscale Filter
Note: the downscale filter should **always** only be used if you are downscaling the output resolution.

**Billinear** - Fastest, but blurry if scaling</br>
**Area** - Fast, but has decent scaling</br>
**Bicubic** - Slow, but has good scaling</br>
**Lanczos** - Slowest, but has the best scaling</br>

Choose depending on your hardware.</br>

## FPS
Use `Common FPS Values`, and choose `60 FPS` (if your computer **cannot** handle `60 FPS`, please go ahead and use `30 FPS`).
